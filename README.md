# IPL-analytics

I created a database named "fananalytics" on MySQL.I am using XAMPP.
I created two tables named "matches" and "innings" using python script using pymysql package.
"matches" table contains summary of all the IPL matches played during all seasons till 2017.
"innings" table contains information of deliveries of all matches (over by over data) played during all seasons till 2017.
